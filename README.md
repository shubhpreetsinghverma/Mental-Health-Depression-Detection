# Mental-Health-Depression-Detection
A Machine Learning and DBMS-based system for early detection of depression among students and working professionals using NLP on Reddit mental health data, with structured data storage in SQL and predictive analytics for mental health risk assessment.

This project focuses on the early detection of depression among students and working professionals using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system analyzes text-based mental health data (such as Reddit posts) to identify potential signs of depression.

The project integrates:
- Machine Learning for prediction of mental health risk
- NLP techniques for text processing and feature extraction
- SQL-based database for structured storage of user data and predictions

The ultimate goal is to provide an automated, data-driven approach to identify early warning signs of mental health issues and support preventive mental health care.
